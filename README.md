# Login Form using C#

## Everyday is a learning day !

Login forms are one of the most important user interface elements in mobile applications and websites page with a members-only area.

You all need to be familiar with C# and MySql in order to create this login form. This login form asks the user for their username and password, then verifies that the information is stored in the database. If the username and password are in the database, the login form indicates that the login was successful and takes you to the menu form.
When the user attempts to log in with just one of those details, the login form will reject the login attempt and display an error message. Moreover, this login form supports exit and clear options.

The technologies I've used :

- C#
- MySql
- Text Editor - Visual Studio

#### Thank You Guys & Good Luck!
